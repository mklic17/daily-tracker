## Daily Tracker

As part of Project 2 for our Web Development and CyberSecurity class we designed a C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ruby on rails website that allows users to track nutritional intake and exercise each day. Users will log how many calories, total fat, sodium, total carb, and protein and have a running total at the bottom of the screen. In the bottom right column, is feedback based on the current nutritional input. Feedback ranges from "great" , "Almost There", and "Try Better". Also, on another view users will be able to track their exercises by calories, duration, and date.
